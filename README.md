  <h1>Starting Sustainability</h1>
  <h2>Catching Them Young</h2>
  <p><font size="4">Sustainability , for a student is a concept to reduce the amount of wastage in their daily lives to support the future generations. However this concept needs to be incorporated for the system to actually work.Mindless consumerism and product packaging is one of the main areas where sustainability can be targeted. Every product bought not recylable has a lasting consequence on the environment. 

  Even the Kellogs cereal that we eat, the box is made out of recycled cardboard.
Â Most of the global plastics waste goes into incineration (25%) and landfills (40%), meaning that the proper usage of these materials doesn't take place.
