 skin in the game with greenhouse gas emissions generation of around 8.1%.<br>
 It is however proving to be ephemeral as 
 leading fashion brands across the world are on a mission <br> to provide
 sustainable clothing and packaging to their consumers. This also influences small <br>
 businesses to put their foot in the game, slowly but surely.
