<h1>Fashion and Sustainability</h1>
<p><font size="4"> The environmental impact of fashion has a large amount of 
 skin in the game with greenhouse gas emissions generation of around 8.1%.<br>
 It is proving to be ephemeral as 
 leading fashion brands across the world are on a mission <br> to provide
 sustainable clothing and packaging to their consumers. This also influences small <br>
 businesses to put their foot in the game, slowly but surely. </font></p>
