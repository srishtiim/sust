<p>Hindustan Unilever is one of the instrumental companies for the fastidious rethinking of plastic packaging with its innovative solutions with over 400 brands . With 90 years of heritage, India was the first of its locations where collection and processing of plastic was greater than its consumption. It has connected with UNDP to reach this goal and to protect the lives of informal waste collecters. One of the worlds most famous ice cream Magnum has overcome this challenge to launch recycled plastic ice tubs.  Working with  globally known consumer brands such as  Mars, Mondelēz, Nestlé, PepsiCo to incentivise the recycling of flexible packaging will create a huge impact. </p>
